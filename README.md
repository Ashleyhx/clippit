# Clippit

This project is a React-based PDF parser application that allows users 
to upload a PDF and ask questions based on the extracted text using AI 
services. 

## Features
- Upload a PDF file and extract its text content.
- Choose between OpenAI and Cohere AI for generating responses.
- Ask questions based on the extracted text and receive answers formatted in GitHub-flavored markdown.


Note: You will need to enter your own API key 
to use the corresponding feature. 
You can generate the OpenAI API key from OpenAI's platform 
and the Cohere API key from Cohere's dashboard.
